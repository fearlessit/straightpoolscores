		<h1>What is Simple Straight Pool Score Counter</h1>
		<p>This web app offers a simple as possible score counting system for one game of Straight. You just need to enter the numbers of balls in the table after a turn is finished and enter re-racks. The user interface is intentionally simple for you to be able to use it right from the spot without learning. By using the Switch Turn and Undo buttons you can safely avoid unnecessary input to the app and save time from score bookkeeping to actually playing. You can handle multi-point faults by repetition.</p>
