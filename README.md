# Straight Pool Scores

Straight Pool Score Counter. A web (JavaScript) based simple client to handle a bit challenging task of counting scores in a billiard game called Straight Pool (a.k.a, 14.1 / fourteen and one).

## Demand
Calculating scores needs paper or notepad and somekind of a system to keep tracking the number of remaining balls in the table. This programs does all that for you. But that's it. There is no saving anything to backend (players, games, etc). Frankly there is no backend at all. It's just a web page to help you keep track of the scores of one ongoing game of straight pool. UI is pretty okay. And if you are interested in further development, go ahead :)

Links for rules of this fine pool game, which is simple by the rules, but the game is actually one of the most difficult one pool games to master. IMHO: Straight Pool has, in the field of the pool games, most in common with Snooker.
