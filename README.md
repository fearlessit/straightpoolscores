# Straight Pool Scores

Straight Pool Score Counter. A web (JavaScript) based simple client to handle a bit challenging task
of counting scores in a billiard game called Straight Pool (a.k.a, 14.1 / fourteen and one).

## Demand
Calculating scores needs paper or notepad and somekind of a system to keep tracking the number of
remaining balls in the table. This program does all that for you. But that's it. There is no saving
anything to the backend (players, games, etc.). Frankly, there is no backend at all. It's just a web page
to help you keep track of the scores of one ongoing game of straight pool. UI is pretty okay, and if you
know the rules and are familiar with some way to keep tracking the scores, then by exploring the UI, you
should quickly figure out how to use it.

## Featues
Never the less, here is the list of the basic features:

- The idea is to give information of the remaining ball count when player's turn is over. You can also switch
the turn by clicking the switch turn logo, for example, if nothing went in during the turn. Or even
after a safety battle, to minimize clicks needed, be able to only once correct player in turn.

- When a new rack is about to begin, and 14 balls get lifted back to table, you click the rack image to
tell the program that racking a new set of balls is done.

- If you do illegal shot, just put the red flag on before giving the remaining ball count. 

- There is a Undo button in the menu. Undo feature is able to undo multiple miss clicks, but no redo yet.
- So be careful, at least, when you need to do undo(s).

- If you commit an illegal shot during the game, for example pocket the que ball, just set the red flag
on before giving the ball count remaining.

- You can change the default "Player 1" and "Player 2" names by clicking them.


If you are interested in the further development, go ahead. If that's the cae, maybe dropping a message
for me would be nice?

Links for rules of this fine pool game, which is simple by the rules, but the game is actually one of the
most difficult ones to master in pool. IMHO: Straight Pool has, in the field of the pool games, most in
common with Snooker.
